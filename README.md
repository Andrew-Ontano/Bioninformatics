# Bioninformatics
Tools, pipelines and protocols I employ.

## This repository will house anything I use in bioninformatics.
Standalone scripts are kept in [scripts](scripts/). Each of these can function alone, but some are designed to write intermediate step files, which are then used by multiple other scripts.

All scripts are tested under my machine (AMD Ryzen 64-bit CPU, Cygwin shell, pycharm IDE, Rstudio IDE, etc)
